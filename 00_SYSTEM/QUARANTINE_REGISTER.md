# QUARANTINE REGISTER

Material found alongside the source library that **must not be used as evidence**,
what was wrong with it, and where it now lives.

This file is the Git-visible record. The quarantined files themselves sit under
`01_SOURCE_VIDEOS/`, which `.gitignore` excludes, so they are preserved on disk but
not committed.

## Q-001 — Pre-ingestion derived notes for all 21 lessons, and a synthesized master rulebook

A `README_WHY_QUARANTINED.md` was written into the quarantine folder so the warning
travels with the files.

### Why — evidence

All three findings are against V01, the only lesson whose transcript has been
verified against its audio.

**Finding 1 — a rule cited to a timestamp that says nothing of the kind.**

`01_.../RULES.md` records `V01-R001` at `[00:05:00]`, quoted as the instructor
saying *"Wait for the M15 candle to close before taking the 5/13 EMA cross"*,
marked `Source: Explicit` and `Coding Readiness: Ready`.

The transcript from `[00:04:51]` to `[00:05:32]` is the instructor telling students
not to rush homework in the hour before class. No chart content appears in that
range. Across the whole 54:44 transcript, `EMA` matches 14 times; 13 are the
substring in *email*. The one real occurrence is `[00:19:15]` — *"Do you know how to
read the EMAs in real time?"* — item 10 of a student self-assessment survey. It
states no periods, no cross condition, and no candle-close requirement.

The same file's parameter table sources EMA periods 5 / 13 / 50 / 200 / 800 to
`[00:04:00]`, all marked `Explicit`. Nothing at `[00:04:00]` concerns moving
averages.

**Finding 2 — a visual index for screenshots that were never taken.**

`01_.../VISUAL_INDEX.md` claims "Total Captured Presentation & Annotated Chart
Screenshots: 78" and describes 78 numbered images with filenames, byte sizes, and
per-image descriptions of what is on screen. The lesson's `SCREENSHOTS/` folder
holds **one** image, whose name matches none of the entries.

**Finding 3 — the master rulebook predates ingestion.**

`MASTER_RULEBOOK.md` states `MR-001` … `MR-005` (5/13 EMA cross entry, 10–15 pip
stops beyond HOD/LOD, minimum 1:3 R:R, London 03:30–09:00 EST / New York
09:30–12:00 EST) each marked `Source: Explicit`, none carrying a video ID or
timestamp. It is a Phase-3-shaped consolidated specification produced before Phase 1
had run. Its relationship to the wider Beat The Market Maker literature is not the
issue; it is not derived from these source files and must not be cited as though it
were.

### Pattern

Plausible domain knowledge about the method, formatted in this repository's evidence
conventions, with timestamps attached that do not correspond to what is said at those
timestamps. This is more damaging than having no notes at all: it defeats the
source-traceability the project is built on, and it is specifically the failure mode
`00_SYSTEM/TEMPLATES/INTERPRETATION_TEMPLATE.md` exists to prevent.

### Not quarantined

`TRANSCRIPT.md` files were left in their lesson folders.

- **V01's transcript is verified and in use.** 2,930 lines, monotonic timestamps
  `[00:00:00]` → `[00:54:38]`, against a measured audio duration of 54:43.8. It
  preserves disfluency, crosstalk, student names, and ASR garble rather than
  smoothing them — a fabricated transcript does not contain its own transcription
  errors. Relocated to `02_TRANSCRIPTS/V01/V01_TRANSCRIPT.md`.
- **The other 20 transcripts are UNVERIFIED.** No evidence against them, and none
  for them. Each must be checked against its own audio before that lesson is
  studied. Tracked as issue I-008.

### Handling rule

Do not mine this material for leads. A fabricated rule that happens to be correct is
still not evidence, and going looking for it in a transcript is how a session talks
itself into finding it. The files are retained only as the record of what was
discarded and why.
