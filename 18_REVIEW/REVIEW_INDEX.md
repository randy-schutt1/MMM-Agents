# REVIEW INDEX

Master record of every independent review decision, and the project's running
error statistics.

Maintained by the Reviewer Agent. Append-only for decisions — a superseded decision
stays visible with its round number.

## STATUS

```text
LESSONS REVIEWED: 1
PASSED:           0
IN REMEDIATION:   1  (V01)
AWAITING REVIEW:  0
```

V01 reviewed 2026-08-10 (R1): `REVISE`, confidence HIGH. 0 critical, 2 major.

## DECISION TABLE

| Video | Student Status | Review Version | Reviewer Decision | Critical Issues | Major Issues | Final |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| V01 | REVIEW REQUIRED | R1 | REVISE | 0 | 2 | ⏳ |

### Row template

```text
| V01 | PASS | R1 | REVISE | 0 | 2 | ⏳ |
| V01 | PASS | R2 | PASS   | 0 | 0 | ✅ |
```

Each review round gets its **own row**. Earlier rows are never edited or removed —
the progression from `REVISE` to `PASS` is part of the learning record.

### Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Reviewer PASS — advancement authorized |
| ⏳ | REVISE — in remediation |
| ⛔ | BLOCKED — substantial remediation required |
| 🔍 | Awaiting review |
| 👤 | Human review required |
| — | Not yet reached |

**Student Status** uses the student vocabulary (`PASS` / `REVIEW REQUIRED` /
`BLOCKED`); **Reviewer Decision** uses the reviewer vocabulary (`PASS` / `REVISE` /
`BLOCKED`). They are different actors' judgements and are deliberately not merged
(`SETUP_ISSUES.md` I-001).

## RECURRING ERROR COUNTS

Updated after every review. Reveals systematic weakness over time — a code that
keeps recurring is a training problem, not a lesson problem.

| Code | Description | Count | Lessons |
|---|---|---:|---|
| E01 | Source misquote | 0 | |
| E02 | Unsupported generalization | 1 | V01 |
| E03 | Missed qualifier | 0 | |
| E04 | Wrong sequence | 0 | |
| E05 | Wrong pattern boundary | 0 | |
| E06 | False positive | 0 | |
| E07 | False negative | 0 | |
| E08 | Hindsight contamination | 0 | |
| E09 | Cherry-picking | 0 | |
| E10 | Incomplete homework | 1 | V01 |
| E11 | Missing provenance | 1 | V01 |
| E12 | Ambiguity treated as rule | 0 | |
| E13 | Contradiction ignored | 1 | V01 |
| E14 | Outcome confused with correctness | 0 | |
| E15 | Machine assumption introduced prematurely | 0 | |
| E16 | Terminology drift | 0 | |
| E17 | Missing negative examples | 0 | |
| E18 | Invalid manual-backtest procedure | 0 | |
| E19 | Data/timeframe inconsistency | 0 | |
| E20 | Other | 6 | V01 |

**Escalation rule:** any code reaching 3 occurrences is a systematic weakness.
Note it in the next cumulative review and consider whether the student protocol
itself needs strengthening — not just the individual lesson.

## SEVERITY TOTALS

| Severity | Total | Open |
|---|---:|---:|
| CRITICAL | 0 | 0 |
| MAJOR | 2 | 2 |
| MINOR | 6 | 6 |
| NOTE | 4 | 4 |

A lesson with unresolved CRITICAL issues cannot pass.

## OPEN RESEARCH ITEMS CARRIED FORWARD

Non-foundational issues that permitted a `PASS` but must not be forgotten.

| # | From | Item | Where tracked | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | V01 R1 | `C-001` — day-count away from the anchor is self-contradicted in source and unresolved by the instructor. No artifact may commit a value. Re-examine at every weekly-holding-period lesson and at the 25% cumulative review | `CONTRADICTIONS.md` C-001 | OPEN |
| 2 | V01 R1 | `I7` — whether "anchor point", "peak formation high/low" and "M or W formation" are one concept. Stays `INFERRED / Low`; **re-adjudicate at V02** | `V01_INTERPRETATION.md` I7 / G4 | OPEN |
| 3 | V01 R1 | H4 / H5 `DEFERRED` pending `I-007` (chart data source). Reclassified in the mastery report 2026-08-10; `D-019` records the general rule. Perform when I-007 closes | `SETUP_ISSUES.md` I-007; `DECISIONS.md` D-019 | OPEN |
| 6 | V01 R1 remediation | The stale *"no screenshot exists for V01"* paragraph appears in **17** ambiguity records, not the 3 instances R1 counted. `A-006` fixed as a dependency; **16 remain** (`A-001`–`A-005`, `A-007`–`A-017`). Several need fresh visual claims (`A-009`, `A-015`, `A-017` have frames bearing on them), so this is study work, not a sweep | `AUTOMATION_AMBIGUITIES.md` | OPEN — refer to R2 |
| 4 | V01 R1 | Re-check `[00:46:04]`, `[00:48:05]`, `[00:48:13]` against the retained mp4 before any session-timing parameter is coded (`M3`) | `V01_INTERPRETATION.md` M3 / Q7 | OPEN |
| 5 | V01 R1 | Dimension B (Recognition) deferred to after V02 defines the trading zone | `V01_MASTERY_REPORT.md` B | OPEN |
