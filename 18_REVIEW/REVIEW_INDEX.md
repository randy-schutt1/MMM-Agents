# REVIEW INDEX

Master record of every independent review decision, and the project's running
error statistics.

Maintained by the Reviewer Agent. Append-only for decisions — a superseded decision
stays visible with its round number.

## STATUS

```text
LESSONS REVIEWED: 1
PASSED:           0
IN REMEDIATION:   1  (V01)
AWAITING REVIEW:  0
```

V01 reviewed 2026-08-10 (R1): `REVISE`, confidence HIGH. 0 critical, 2 major.
V01 re-reviewed 2026-08-10 (R2): `REVISE`, confidence HIGH. 0 critical, 1 major.
R1 findings 2, 4 and 6b closed; R1 finding 1 found **partially applied** and reopened
as R2 finding N1. **V02 remains gated** — D-004 requires reviewer `PASS` on V01.

## DECISION TABLE

| Video | Student Status | Review Version | Reviewer Decision | Critical Issues | Major Issues | Final |
|---|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| V01 | REVIEW REQUIRED | R1 | REVISE | 0 | 2 | ⏳ |
| V01 | REVIEW REQUIRED | R2 | REVISE | 0 | 1 | ⏳ |

### Row template

```text
| V01 | PASS | R1 | REVISE | 0 | 2 | ⏳ |
| V01 | PASS | R2 | PASS   | 0 | 0 | ✅ |
```

Each review round gets its **own row**. Earlier rows are never edited or removed —
the progression from `REVISE` to `PASS` is part of the learning record.

### Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Reviewer PASS — advancement authorized |
| ⏳ | REVISE — in remediation |
| ⛔ | BLOCKED — substantial remediation required |
| 🔍 | Awaiting review |
| 👤 | Human review required |
| — | Not yet reached |

**Student Status** uses the student vocabulary (`PASS` / `REVIEW REQUIRED` /
`BLOCKED`); **Reviewer Decision** uses the reviewer vocabulary (`PASS` / `REVISE` /
`BLOCKED`). They are different actors' judgements and are deliberately not merged
(`SETUP_ISSUES.md` I-001).

## RECURRING ERROR COUNTS

Updated after every review. Reveals systematic weakness over time — a code that
keeps recurring is a training problem, not a lesson problem.

| Code | Description | Count | Lessons |
|---|---|---:|---|
| E01 | Source misquote | 0 | |
| E02 | Unsupported generalization | 3 | V01 (R1 ×1, R2 ×2) |
| E03 | Missed qualifier | 0 | |
| E04 | Wrong sequence | 0 | |
| E05 | Wrong pattern boundary | 0 | |
| E06 | False positive | 0 | |
| E07 | False negative | 0 | |
| E08 | Hindsight contamination | 0 | |
| E09 | Cherry-picking | 0 | |
| E10 | Incomplete homework | 1 | V01 |
| E11 | Missing provenance | 5 | V01 (R1 ×1, R2 ×4) |
| E12 | Ambiguity treated as rule | 0 | |
| E13 | Contradiction ignored | 1 | V01 |
| E14 | Outcome confused with correctness | 0 | |
| E15 | Machine assumption introduced prematurely | 0 | |
| E16 | Terminology drift | 0 | |
| E17 | Missing negative examples | 0 | |
| E18 | Invalid manual-backtest procedure | 0 | |
| E19 | Data/timeframe inconsistency | 0 | |
| E20 | Other | 8 | V01 (R1 ×6, R2 ×2) |

**Escalation rule:** any code reaching 3 occurrences is a systematic weakness.
Note it in the next cumulative review and consider whether the student protocol
itself needs strengthening — not just the individual lesson.

### ESCALATION TRIGGERED 2026-08-10 (R2)

Three codes have reached or passed the threshold on a single lesson.

- **`E11` — missing provenance (5).** The substantive defect. Across two rounds,
  eight statements were found citing a timestamp that does not carry their words:
  `S19`, `S27`-collision ×3 more locations, `X2`, `X3`, `S29`, and H5 in three
  files including an `ACTIVE` decision record. **No quotation was fabricated** — in
  every case the words exist in the recording and are quoted accurately; only the
  citation is off, typically by 10–40 s and usually because the passage start was
  cited instead of the sentence. This is the same reflex that produced `Q-001`,
  caught at the cheap end. **Protocol implication:** `STUDY_PROTOCOL.md` should
  require that a quoted sentence cite the marker its *first words* fall under, and
  that passage-level citation be written as a range (`[a]`–`[b]`), never as a bare
  start. Raise at the 25% cumulative review.
- **`E20` — other (8).** Almost entirely stale status text: files asserting a state
  of the world that was true when written and is now false. Same class as `Q-001`
  in miniature. **Protocol implication:** any file carrying a `STATUS` block or a
  "none / empty / not captured" assertion should be re-read at the close of every
  session that changes what it describes.
- **`E02` — unsupported generalization (3).** All three concern the blue/red boxes.
  Two of the three were *introduced during remediation of the first*, which is
  itself the lesson: a correction is new work and carries the same generalization
  risk as the original.

## SEVERITY TOTALS

Cumulative across R1 and R2.

| Severity | Total | Open | Closed |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| CRITICAL | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| MAJOR | 3 | 1 | 2 |
| MINOR | 10 | 9 | 1 |
| NOTE | 7 | 7 | 0 |

A lesson with unresolved CRITICAL issues cannot pass.

**MAJOR ledger.** R1 raised 2. Finding 2 (`E10`, dimension F) is **closed** — verified
applied in R2. Finding 1 (`E02`, the box reading) is **closed in three of four
locations**; the fourth is reopened as R2 finding N1 and is the single open MAJOR.

**Closed this round:** R1 findings 2 (MAJOR), 4 (MINOR), 6b (part of MINOR finding 6).

## OPEN RESEARCH ITEMS CARRIED FORWARD

Non-foundational issues that permitted a `PASS` but must not be forgotten.

| # | From | Item | Where tracked | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | V01 R1 | `C-001` — day-count away from the anchor is self-contradicted in source and unresolved by the instructor. No artifact may commit a value. Re-examine at every weekly-holding-period lesson and at the 25% cumulative review | `CONTRADICTIONS.md` C-001 | OPEN |
| 2 | V01 R1 | `I7` — whether "anchor point", "peak formation high/low" and "M or W formation" are one concept. Stays `INFERRED / Low`; **re-adjudicate at V02** | `V01_INTERPRETATION.md` I7 / G4 | OPEN |
| 3 | V01 R1 | H4 / H5 `DEFERRED` pending `I-007` (chart data source). Reclassified in the mastery report 2026-08-10; `D-019` records the general rule. Perform when I-007 closes | `SETUP_ISSUES.md` I-007; `DECISIONS.md` D-019 | OPEN |
| 4 | V01 R1 | Re-check `[00:46:04]`, `[00:48:05]`, `[00:48:13]` against the retained mp4 before any session-timing parameter is coded (`M3`) | `V01_INTERPRETATION.md` M3 / Q7 | OPEN |
| 5 | V01 R1 | Dimension B (Recognition) deferred to after V02 defines the trading zone | `V01_MASTERY_REPORT.md` B | OPEN |
| 6 | V01 R1 remediation | The stale *"no screenshot exists for V01"* paragraph appears in **17** ambiguity records, not the 3 instances R1 counted. `A-006` fixed as a dependency; **16 remain** (`A-001`–`A-005`, `A-007`–`A-017`). **Adjudicated by R2 (Part 3) — this is partly study work, but the scope stated here was wrong.** `A-009`, `A-015` and `A-017` were named as needing fresh visual claims; all three already carry sound visual updates, audited and upheld in R2. The records that actually need a fresh visual determination are **`A-002`, `A-008`, `A-016`** (determinations supplied in R2 Part 3.3), plus `A-003`'s five self-contradicting fields. `A-011` / `A-012` / `A-014` gain slide-text evidence; `A-007` needs a "frame exists, defines nothing" note; the remaining eight are mechanical | `AUTOMATION_AMBIGUITIES.md`; `18_REVIEW/V01/V01_REVIEW_R2.md` Part 3 | OPEN — scope now specified |
| 7 | V01 R2 | Citation hygiene is the project's recurring weakness (`E11` ×5). Eight statements across two rounds cite a timestamp that does not carry their words. No quotation is fabricated. Consider requiring in `STUDY_PROTOCOL.md` that a quoted sentence cite the marker its first words fall under, and that passage-level citation be written as an explicit range | `18_REVIEW/REVIEW_INDEX.md` escalation note; raise at `CUMULATIVE_25.md` | OPEN |
| 8 | V01 R2 | `SETUP_ISSUES.md` I-006 still describes the SWF header frame-rate speedup as "an untested faster path", but `DECISIONS.md` D-020 has since ruled it out. Same staleness class as R1 finding 6; not blocking V01 | `SETUP_ISSUES.md` I-006; `DECISIONS.md` D-020 | OPEN |
