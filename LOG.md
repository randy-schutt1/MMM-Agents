# RESEARCH LOG

Chronological, **append-only** research journal for the MMM-MASTERY project.

Rules:

- Every meaningful work session appends one entry, newest at the bottom.
- Never rewrite or delete a historical entry because later understanding changed.
  Append a new correction entry instead and reference the entry it corrects.
- Both Student and Reviewer sessions log here. Reviewer entries are labelled
  `Reviewer Session`.
- Entry format is defined in `MMM_MASTER_STUDENT_RESEARCH_AGENT.md` §6 (student)
  and `MMM_INDEPENDENT_REVIEWER_TEACHER_AGENT.md` §6 (reviewer).

## 2026-08-10 — Session 1 — Infrastructure Build (Phase 0)

### Objective

Build the complete operational workspace for the Student Agent and the Independent
Reviewer Agent, derived from the two governing files, so that Video 1 can begin
immediately once the bootcamp source videos become locally available.

Infrastructure only. Explicitly **not** a study session.

### Work Completed

- Read both governing files in full:
  - `MMM_MASTER_STUDENT_RESEARCH_AGENT.md`
  - `MMM_INDEPENDENT_REVIEWER_TEACHER_AGENT.md`
- Created the full directory structure (`00_SYSTEM/` … `18_REVIEW/`, `scripts/`),
  built at the repository root rather than in a nested `MMM-MASTERY/` folder, to
  avoid duplicate project nesting.
- Created root documents: `README.md`, `LOG.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.gitignore`.
- Created the `00_SYSTEM/` operating documents: agent roles, study protocol,
  mastery standard, review protocol, remediation protocol, source ingestion
  protocol, file naming standard, course progress, decisions, source manifest,
  session start/close checklists, setup issues, and both session prompts.
- Created 11 reusable templates in `00_SYSTEM/TEMPLATES/`.
- Created review infrastructure: `18_REVIEW/REVIEW_INDEX.md` and empty cumulative
  review templates for the 25% / 50% / 75% / final checkpoints.
- Created empty, clearly-labelled placeholder logs for ambiguities and
  contradictions, and a concept index with no concepts in it.
- Created `scripts/validate_project.py`, a structural-only health check.
- Added a `README.md` contract to every numbered directory.

### Key Findings

None relating to the Market Maker Method. **No course content was analysed,
inferred, or written**, because no source video was accessible in this session.

Four inconsistencies between the two governing files were identified and recorded
in `00_SYSTEM/SETUP_ISSUES.md` (I-001 … I-004) rather than silently resolved. The
most important is I-001: the Student file uses the mastery vocabulary
`PASS / REVIEW REQUIRED / BLOCKED` while the Reviewer file uses
`PASS / REVISE / BLOCKED`. Provisional handling: the two vocabularies belong to two
different actors and are kept separate, with the reviewer decision as the only
progression gate. Flagged for human confirmation.

### Manual Backtesting

None. No charts were studied, no trades were reviewed, and no historical data was
examined. Manual backtesting cannot begin before lesson content exists.

### Ambiguities

`10_AMBIGUITIES/AUTOMATION_AMBIGUITIES.md` created and intentionally empty — zero
course ambiguities recorded, because zero course material has been seen.

### Contradictions

`11_CONTRADICTIONS/CONTRADICTIONS.md` created and intentionally empty — zero course
contradictions recorded. (Governing-file setup inconsistencies are tracked
separately in `00_SYSTEM/SETUP_ISSUES.md`; that file is about project
infrastructure, not about the course.)

### Decisions

Recorded D-001 through D-014 in `00_SYSTEM/DECISIONS.md`, covering: repository as
persistent memory, one lesson per session, separate independent reviewer sessions,
reviewer PASS as the progression gate, manual backtesting inside the Student Phase,
automated backtesting deferred, GBP/USD as primary instrument, evidence hierarchy,
no win-rate optimization, no premature machine rules, source video exclusion from
Git, repository privacy, root-level layout, and unverified course length.

### Files Created/Updated

- Root: `README.md`, `LOG.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.gitignore`
- `00_SYSTEM/`: `AGENT_ROLE.md`, `STUDY_PROTOCOL.md`, `MASTERY_STANDARD.md`,
  `REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md`, `REMEDIATION_PROTOCOL.md`,
  `SOURCE_INGESTION_PROTOCOL.md`, `FILE_NAMING_STANDARD.md`,
  `COURSE_PROGRESS.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `SOURCE_MANIFEST.md`,
  `SESSION_START.md`, `SESSION_CLOSE.md`, `SETUP_ISSUES.md`,
  `STUDENT_SESSION_PROMPT.md`, `REVIEWER_SESSION_PROMPT.md`
- `00_SYSTEM/TEMPLATES/`: 11 templates
- `18_REVIEW/`: `REVIEW_INDEX.md`, `CUMULATIVE_25.md`, `CUMULATIVE_50.md`,
  `CUMULATIVE_75.md`, `FINAL_COURSE_REVIEW.md`
- `10_AMBIGUITIES/AUTOMATION_AMBIGUITIES.md`,
  `11_CONTRADICTIONS/CONTRADICTIONS.md`,
  `08_CONCEPT_LIBRARY/CONCEPT_INDEX.md`
- `scripts/validate_project.py`, `scripts/README.md`
- `README.md` in each numbered directory

### Source Material Status

**No bootcamp video files were accessible during this session.**

- `01_SOURCE_VIDEOS/` contains no media.
- `00_SYSTEM/SOURCE_MANIFEST.md` contains zero video rows.
- No filename, lesson count, lesson order, or lesson title has been assumed or
  recorded. The working figure of "~21 usable videos in a folder of ~24 files" is
  an unverified expectation carried from the project owner and is labelled as such
  everywhere it appears.

### Git

Branch: `claude/add-documents-repository-fdfb3u`
Remote: `https://github.com/randy-schutt1/MMM-Agents` — verified **private**.

Commits from this session:

```text
chore: initialize MMM mastery project structure
docs: add student and reviewer operating system
docs: add lesson and review templates
chore: add project validation workflow
```

(Exact hashes are visible via `git log`.)

### Next Action

**Blocked on human input.** Nothing further can be done until the bootcamp video
library is locally accessible to an agent session.

When it is, start a **Student** session with:

> "Source videos are now available. Run the ingestion protocol, verify the course
> order, and begin Video 1."

The session will then:

1. Run `00_SYSTEM/SOURCE_INGESTION_PROTOCOL.md` (inventory, SHA-256, duration,
   proposed order, ordering-confidence flags).
2. Populate `00_SYSTEM/SOURCE_MANIFEST.md` and expand
   `00_SYSTEM/COURSE_PROGRESS.md` to the real lesson count.
3. Pause for human confirmation of any lesson ordering marked uncertain.
4. Process **V01 only**, then stop and request an independent reviewer session.

Secondary, optional: confirm or correct setup issues I-001 … I-004 in
`00_SYSTEM/SETUP_ISSUES.md`.

## 2026-08-10 — Session 2 — Checkpoint Commit Cadence + Infrastructure Audit

### Objective

(1) Adopt the project owner's instruction to commit at frequent checkpoints rather
than at session end. (2) Independently re-audit the Phase 0 infrastructure build.

### Correction Note

The checkpoint-cadence change (commit `31fd4d8`) was committed and pushed
**without appending a LOG.md entry at the time** — a violation of the
session-close protocol this project itself defines. Per the log rules, this entry
corrects the omission rather than rewriting history. The audit below caught it.

### Work Completed

- Recorded D-015 (checkpoint commit cadence) in `00_SYSTEM/DECISIONS.md` and
  propagated it to `SESSION_CLOSE.md` §6, `README.md` §13, and both session
  prompts. Commit `31fd4d8`.
- Full infrastructure audit:
  - All 38 files required by the setup instruction verified present and non-empty.
  - All D-001…D-015 and I-001…I-007 cross-references resolve; no dangling
    file references (the `VXX`/`NNN` patterns are intentional placeholders).
  - `COURSE_PROGRESS.md` header matches the requested column set exactly.
  - `.gitignore` covers every item from the setup instruction's list.
  - README internal section references (§11, §13) verified against actual
    numbering.
  - Negative-tested `scripts/validate_project.py`: it fails correctly when a
    required file is removed (96/0/1) and passes when restored (97/0/0) — the
    green result is not vacuous.
- Fixes from the audit (this session's commit):
  - This LOG entry (finding 1: missing Session 2 log entry).
  - `CHANGELOG.md` 0.1.1 entry for the D-015 process change (finding 2).
  - Clarifying comment on the `*.ts` pattern in `.gitignore` (finding 3: it means
    MPEG transport stream; noted so it isn't mistaken for a stray TypeScript
    exclusion later).

### Key Findings

No Market Maker Method content anywhere in the repository — confirmed by direct
inspection: 0 manifest rows, 0 progress rows, 0 concepts, 0 ambiguity records,
0 contradiction records, 0 reviews, 0 backtests, 0 content files in any lesson
directory. All course-material directories contain only README contracts.

### Manual Backtesting

None. Not applicable before source ingestion.

### Ambiguities / Contradictions

None (course-level). Infrastructure issues remain I-001…I-007 in
`00_SYSTEM/SETUP_ISSUES.md`, unchanged.

### Decisions

D-015 (see above). No new decisions from the audit.

### Files Created/Updated

`LOG.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.gitignore` (this commit);
`00_SYSTEM/DECISIONS.md`, `00_SYSTEM/SESSION_CLOSE.md`, `README.md`,
`00_SYSTEM/STUDENT_SESSION_PROMPT.md`, `00_SYSTEM/REVIEWER_SESSION_PROMPT.md`
(commit `31fd4d8`).

### Git

```text
31fd4d8 docs: adopt checkpoint commit cadence
<this commit> docs: log session 2 and record audit fixes
```

### Next Action

Unchanged from Session 1: **blocked on source video access.** When available,
start a Student session with the ingestion instruction in
`00_SYSTEM/STUDENT_SESSION_PROMPT.md` (first-run variant). Optional: confirm
I-001…I-004 provisional handling.
